# Security Scan Report

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Repository**: rjeans/automation
**Visibility**: Public
**Scan Type**: Comprehensive forensic analysis

## Executive Summary

✅ **REPOSITORY IS SAFE FOR PUBLIC RELEASE**

Comprehensive forensic scan completed with 7 different security checks. No secrets, private keys, API tokens, or sensitive credentials found in the repository or git history.

## Scan Results

### ✅ Scan #1: Common Secret Patterns
- **AWS Keys**: None found
- **Private Keys**: None found
- **Hardcoded Passwords**: None found (only examples in documentation)

**Finding**: Passwords found in documentation (`BASELINE.md`, `docs/07-n8n-deployment.md`) are example/placeholder values like `n8n-postgresql-password`, not real credentials.

### ✅ Scan #2: Tokens and API Keys
- **Tokens**: None found (only placeholders in docs)
- **API Keys**: None found

**Finding**: One reference to `token=your-token-here` in GITOPS-ROADMAP.md is a documentation example.

### ✅ Scan #3: Certificates and Encoded Secrets
- **Base64 Encoded Secrets**: None found
- **Certificate Files**: `./age.key` found but NOT tracked in git (properly ignored)

**Action**: Verified `age.key` is in .gitignore and not tracked.

### ✅ Scan #4: Git History Analysis
- **Secret Files in History**: None found
- **Removed Secrets**: None found

**Finding**: Git log shows clean history with no secret-related commits. Repository was previously cleaned (commit: e12d490 "Initial commit - clean repository after security remediation").

###  Scan #5: Infrastructure Details
- **Private IP Addresses**: Found in documentation only (README, ROADMAP, docs)
- **Hostnames**: `.local` references in documentation/examples only

**Assessment**: ACCEPTABLE
**Rationale**: IP addresses (192.168.1.x) are in documentation showing homelab setup. This is standard practice for infrastructure-as-code examples and doesn't expose actual infrastructure since NAT/firewall provides security.

###  Scan #6: Domain Names
- **Domains Found**: `jeansy.org` in ingress configurations
  - `dashboard.jeansy.org` - flux/clusters/talos/apps/cluster-dashboard/ingress-external.yaml
  - `n8n.jeansy.org` - flux/clusters/talos/apps/n8n/ingress-external.yaml

**Assessment**: ACCEPTABLE (with user confirmation)
**Rationale**: Domain names in ingress configurations are standard in public infrastructure repos. Cloudflare Tunnel provides security layer. No security risk as:
1. Domain itself is not sensitive
2. Cloudflare handles authentication and access control
3. Origin IP is hidden by Cloudflare Tunnel
4. Standard practice in public GitOps repos

**Recommendation**: If privacy is preferred, could be genericized to `example.com` in documentation.

### ✅ Scan #7: High-Entropy Strings
- **Potential Secrets**: None found
- **High-Entropy Strings**: Only Docker image SHAs and documentation hashes

**Finding**: All high-entropy strings are legitimate (container image IDs, documentation examples).

## .gitignore Analysis

Current .gitignore properly excludes:

```gitignore
# Secrets
*.key, *.pem
secrets.yaml, secrets.yml
talosconfig, kubeconfig
controlplane.yaml, worker.yaml

# Environment files
.env, .env.local, .env.*.local

# Cloudflare Tunnel tokens
*tunnel-token*, cloudflare-token*

# Go development
vendor/, *.exe, *.dll, *.so

# Docker images
*.tar, *.tar.gz

# Playwright MCP
.playwright-mcp/
```

**Assessment**: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE and properly configured

## Files Checked

- Total files in repository: ~150
- Tracked by git: ~140
- Excluded by .gitignore: ~10
- Scanned in git history: All commits since e12d490

## Public Information Disclosed (Acceptable)

1. **Homelab IP Range**: 192.168.1.0/24 (standard private range)
2. **Domain**: jeansy.org (public domain, protected by Cloudflare)
3. **Technology Stack**: Talos, Kubernetes, Flux, n8n, Traefik (documented infrastructure)
4. **Architecture**: 4x Raspberry Pi (hardware details in README)

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
All disclosed information is either:
- Standard homelab configuration
- Protected by additional security layers (Cloudflare, NAT, firewall)
- Educational/documentation value outweighs privacy concern
- Common practice in open-source infrastructure-as-code repos

## Sensitive Information Properly Protected

✅ **Stored Locally** (not in repo):
- Talos machine configurations (`~/.talos-secrets/automation/`)
- Kubernetes secrets (deployed via kubectl, not in git)
- Cloudflare tunnel token (referenced as secret name, not value)
- SOPS age key (age.key in .gitignore)
- TLS certificates (not in repo)

✅ **Referenced but Not Exposed**:
- Secret names mentioned: `talos-config`, `cloudflare-tunnel-token`
- ConfigMap names and structure visible, but no sensitive values
- Flux will decrypt SOPS secrets at runtime (when implemented)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- ✅ **No action required** - Repository is safe for public release

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Domain Genericization** (optional, low priority):
   - If privacy preferred, replace `jeansy.org` with `example.com` in documentation
   - Keep actual domain in ingress configs (required for Flux)

2. **Add SECURITY.md** (recommended):
   - Document that all secrets are stored locally
   - Explain .gitignore strategy
   - Provide contact for security issues

3. **SOPS Implementation** (future):
   - Already documented in GITOPS-ROADMAP.md
   - Will enable safe storage of encrypted secrets in git
   - Age key properly excluded from repo

4. **Pre-commit Hooks** (optional):
   - Install git-secrets or trufflehog
   - Automated scanning before each commit
   - Prevents accidental secret commits

## Comparison with Industry Standards

This repository follows security best practices seen in popular public infrastructure repos:

| Practice | This Repo | Industry Standard | ✓/✗ |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| Secrets in .gitignore | ✅ | ✅ | ✓ |
| SOPS for encrypted secrets | Planned | Optional | ✓ |
| Domain names in code | ✅ | ✅ (common) | ✓ |
| Private IPs in docs | ✅ | ✅ (acceptable) | ✓ |
| Git history clean | ✅ | ✅ | ✓ |
| Certificate files excluded | ✅ | ✅ | ✓ |

Examples of similar public repos:
- https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops (homelab with domain names)
- https://github.com/billimek/k8s-gitops (full homelab config public)
- https://github.com/khuedoan/homelab (complete homelab including IPs)

## Conclusion

✅ **APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE**

The repository contains no secrets, credentials, or sensitive data that would compromise security. All disclosed information (domain, IP ranges, architecture) is either protected by security layers or represents standard homelab configuration commonly shared in the infrastructure-as-code community.

**Security Posture**: Strong
**Privacy Posture**: Acceptable for educational/portfolio use
**Compliance**: Meets industry standards for public infrastructure repos
