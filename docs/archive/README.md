# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that is no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Contents

- **02-talos-installation.md** - Original detailed installation guide
  - Replaced by: [../02-cluster-rebuild.md](../02-cluster-rebuild.md)
  - Reason: Redundant with rebuild guide; rebuild guide is more streamlined and practical
  - Archived: 2025-10-06

## Why Archive?

The original installation guide had significant overlap with the rebuild guide. Since this is a personal project and the cluster has been successfully built, the streamlined rebuild guide serves both initial builds and rebuilds more effectively.

## Using Archived Docs

These documents are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Alternative approaches or explanations
- Troubleshooting edge cases

For current cluster operations, use the active documentation in the parent directory.
